# Soc-Project
Details regarding timeline and progress in the project
* Completed basics of python videos on you tube and also started the libraries like numpy,panda,matplotlib.
* Started watching the TensorFlow Package on you Tube & also read about an article on how to perform automatic music generation.
* Completed Tensor Flow Package and the article.
* Learning and Understanding the code and applying some tweaks to see the results.
# Musify: Music-Composition using Artificial Intelligence
The aim of ths Project was to create new piece of music using Piano Notes
# About the Project
* Platform : Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook / Visual Studio Code
* Language : Python 3.8
* Libraries Used : Tensorflow, Music21, Keras, NumPy, Sklearn, tqdm
* Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/classical-music-midi
# File Structure
* albeniz/ : This is the dataset folder containing various midi files of different composers.
* Code File for Musify.ipynb : In this file, we will build, train and test our model.
* MOD/ : This directory contains optimizer, metrics, and weights of our trained model.
* AI_composed_music.mid : This is a music file of predicted notes.
* Python basics and Libraries Practice Files/ : Contains various files related to python libraries and basics made while learning and practice.
* Tensor_Flow_basics_and_Regression.ipynb : Contains code related to Tensor Flow made while learning and practice.
* Musify Presentation.pptx : Final Presentation of the Project.
* Final Document SOC-Musify
* Final Video SOC-Musify
# Follow the steps and compose music using AI
* STEP 1 : Download the files from the repository by clicking on Code button
* STEP 2 : Install Libraries using pip command (In Anaconda Prompt)
* STEP 3 : Open code.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook / Visual Studio Code
* STEP 4 : Run all the cells one by one and check the output
* STEP 5 : Wait for the model training as it takes about 7-8 hours
* STEP 6 : Run the last cell and a file named as AI_composed_music.mid will be saved
* STEP 7 : Play the file AI_composed_music.mid
* You have composed your own music by using AI. Some of the parameters can be tweaked in the code for different results.
