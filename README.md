# Soc-Project
Details regarding timeline and progress in the project
* Completed basics of python videos on you tube and also started the libraries like numpy,panda,matplotlib.
* Started watching the TensorFlow Package on you Tube & also read about an article on how to perform automatic music generation.
* Completed Tensor Flow Package and the article.
* Learning and Understanding the code and applying some tweaks to see the results.
# Musify: Music-Composition using Artificial Intelligence
The aim of ths Project was to create new piece of music using Piano Notes
